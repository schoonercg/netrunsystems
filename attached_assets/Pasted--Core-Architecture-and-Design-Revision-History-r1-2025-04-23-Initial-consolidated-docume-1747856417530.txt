   - Supports both subscription-level and resource group-level delegation
   - Enables eligible authorizations for just-in-time privileged access

2. **Permission Management System**
   - Five distinct permission plans with different access levels
   - Role definition packages for each plan
   - Custom role assignments for specific scenarios
   - Permission validation and verification mechanisms

3. **Security and Compliance Framework**
   - Multi-factor authentication enforcement
   - Conditional access policy integration
   - Comprehensive audit logging
   - Compliance monitoring and reporting

4. **Management Portal**
   - Cross-tenant resource visibility
   - Delegation management interface
   - User and role assignment dashboard
   - Activity monitoring and reporting

5. **Add-on Integration Framework**
   - Standardized APIs for add-on connectivity
   - Shared authentication and authorization
   - Cross-tenant data access controls
   - Extensible plugin architecture

   - Audit logging capabilities

2. **Standard Management Plan**
   - Contributor role for specific resource types
   - Management permissions for day-to-day operations
   - Resource configuration capabilities
   - Operational monitoring and alerting

3. **Advanced Management Plan**
   - Contributor role across multiple resource types
   - Advanced management capabilities
   - Resource deployment permissions
   - Performance optimization tools

4. **Security Management Plan**
   - Security Admin role assignments
   - Vulnerability assessment permissions
   - Security policy management
   - Threat detection and response capabilities

5. **Premium Just-in-Time Access Plan**
   - Owner role eligible authorizations
   - Time-limited privileged access
   - Multi-level approval workflow
   - Enhanced audit logging

### Security Implementation

The security framework includes:

1. **Authentication Controls**
   - Multi-factor authentication enforcement
   - Conditional access policy integration
   - Identity protection features
   - Session management and timeouts

2. **Authorization Mechanisms**
   - Role-based access control
   - Just-in-time privileged access
   - Least privilege principle enforcement
   - Separation of duties

3. **Audit and Monitoring**
   - Comprehensive activity logging
   - Real-time alert generation
   - Suspicious activity detection
   - Compliance reporting

4. **Data Protection**
   - Data isolation between tenants
   - Encryption for data in transit and at rest
   - Access controls for sensitive information
   - Data retention and purging policies

### Management Portal Architecture

The management portal is built on a modern web architecture:

1. **Frontend Layer**
