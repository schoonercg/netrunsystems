Interkon Cloud Management Suite ‚Äî The MSP‚Äôs Fast-Lane to Secure, Profitable Azure Operations üöÄ
TL;DR for busy consultants:
Interkon slashes the ‚Äúcan-you-add-my-account?‚Äù back-and-forth, gives you surgical-grade access controls that auditors love, and drops a white-label dashboard on your lap so you can resell cloud governance like a pro‚Äîwithout hiring more engineers or memorizing ARM templates.

1. Lightning-Fast Tenant On-Boarding
Pain Today	How Interkon Fixes It
Waiting days for client global-admin invites	Just-In-Time Connector spins up least-privilege roles in minutes, using OAuth + Azure Lighthouse under the hood. No shared passwords, ever.
Spreadsheet chaos tracking which engineer can see what	Multi-Tenant Inventory auto-discovers subscriptions, resource groups, and policy exemptions, tagging each with SLA and billing owner.
Manual portal clicks to add every new customer	Blueprint-as-Code wizard lets you enroll & baseline a tenant from a single JSON file (or Terraform snippet).

2. Granular Delegation & Zero-Trust Access
‚Ä¢	Role Packs ‚Äì Pre-built, least-privilege RBAC bundles (e.g., Billing-Only, Backup-Operator, Security-Responder) you can assign with two clicks.
‚Ä¢	Time-Boxed Elevation ‚Äì Consultants request elevated rights for, say, 4 hours. Clients approve from email or Teams; rights auto-revoke. Bye-bye, standing global-admin.
‚Ä¢	Audit-Ready Logs ‚Äì Every elevation, policy change, or ARM deployment feeds into a tamper-proof log (exportable to your SIEM or the client‚Äôs).

3. Security & Compliance on Autopilot
‚Ä¢	Policy Guardrails ‚Äì CIS / NIST / ISO 27001 baselines shipped out-of-the-box; flip a toggle and they deploy across all managed tenants.
‚Ä¢	Drift Alerts ‚Äì Real-time events when someone disables MFA or opens an extra-wide NSG rule. Color-coded severity, routed to ITSM.
‚Ä¢	Cost-Anomaly Sniffer ‚Äì Machine-learning model flags the ‚Äúoops I left that GPU on all weekend‚Äù moments before the invoice hits.
