Meet Interkast: your always-on creative teammate
Imagine having a super-organized friend who never sleeps, speaks every social-media dialect, and cheer-leads your brand 24/7. That’s Interkast. Behind the scenes it quietly syndicates your posts—think “copy once, appear everywhere”—then lines them up on an intelligent calendar so your TikToks, Reels, Pins, and Tweets hit exactly when your audience is scrolling. You sketch the big idea; Interkast figures out where, when, and how often it should live, and even suggests new angles when inspiration runs low (because the algorithm doesn’t wait for writer’s block). In short, it’s the stress-free way to plan, publish, and measure a whole campaign without juggling ten apps—or ten cups of coffee. ☕️🚀

Interkast — Feature Deep-Dive for Power Posters 🚀
Below is a tour of the brains and brawn behind Interkast. I’ve grouped the features by the user problem they solve, so you can picture how the pieces click together inside a real-world workflow.
________________________________________
1. Content Capture: “Post once, repurpose forever.”
•	Private-Profile Ingestion – Connect a hidden Instagram/TikTok account (or any “sandbox” profile). Anything you publish there is auto-imported into Interkast’s Unified Inbox within minutes. No downloading, re-uploading, or screenshot shenanigans required.
•	Bulk Cloud Folders – Drop raw footage, product shots, or design files into a shared Drive/OneDrive/Dropbox folder; Interkast hoovers them up, tags them by file type, and turns each asset into a draft post.
•	Spreadsheet & Text Prompts – Paste a CSV of captions, product SKUs, event dates, or even a column of wacky shower-thought ideas. The system pairs them with matching visuals or asks our built-in AI designer to whip up something fresh.

2. Smart Production: “From raw to ready.”
•	AI Caption & Hashtag Brain – Generates first-pass copy in brand voice, mines trending hashtags, and localizes phrasing per platform.
•	Autotrim & Format Converter – One upload becomes every required aspect ratio, from 9:16 Reels to 1:1 Pinterest Pins.
•	Template-Driven Storyboards – Choose a five-beat arc (hook → behind-the-scenes → demo → testimonial → CTA) and Interkast auto-slices your media to fill the frames.
•	Brand Guardrails – Logo placement, color palettes, and banned words lists are enforced automatically so nothing rogue slips through.
________________________________________
3. Approval & Collaboration: “Keep the control, ditch the chaos.”
•	One-Click Approvals – Each drafted post lands in your queue with ✅ / ✏️ buttons. Accept it, tweak the copy, or swap media—no messy email chains.
•	Version Compare & Rollback – See diffs between revisions and restore a previous version if you regret that 2 a.m. edit.
•	Role-Based Access – Freelance copywriters can’t hit “Publish,” interns can’t fiddle with brand assets, and you stay in the driver’s seat.
________________________________________
4. Scheduling & Delivery: “Algorithm-friendly timing on autopilot.”
•	Predictive Time Slots – Machine learning picks the most likely engagement windows for each network (and updates weekly as your audience shifts).
•	Content Recycling – Flag evergreen hits, and Interkast will quietly re-queue them months later when the engagement curve cools.
•	Launch Sequences – Tie multiple posts into a drip campaign triggered by a product drop, holiday, or (true story) your cat’s birthday.
________________________________________
5. Insights & Iteration: “Learn, tweak, repeat.”
•	At-a-Glance Dashboard – Engagement, click-through, and follower deltas surface instantly, with color-coded “what worked” callouts.
•	Post-Mortem Wizard – After each campaign, a single click spits out a PDF summary plus actionable suggestions for the next round. Great for client reports or bragging rights.
•	Trend Radar – Monitors audio and hashtag momentum so you can hop on a viral wave before it crashes.

6. Integrations & Extensibility
•	Zapier & Webhooks – Pipe data to your CRM, newsletter list, or that custom Slack emoji counter you totally don’t procrastinate with.
•	OpenAPI Playground – Developers can script bespoke automations, e.g., auto-posting a “New in store” carousel when your Shopify inventory changes.
•	RAG-Powered Knowledge Base – Feed FAQs or white-papers; the caption generator will cite them, ensuring accuracy (and giving Google warm fuzzies).

How a Typical Day Might Look
1.	Morning: You film a quick “morning grind” clip and post it to your private IG sandbox.
2.	Coffee Time: Interkast ingests the clip, creates five platform-specific variants, and drops them in your approval queue.
3.	Lunch: You green-light three versions, tweak a caption, and schedule the rest for the weekend.
4.	Afternoon: Spreadsheet from the marketing intern auto-generates next week’s product spotlights—already formatted, thumb-stopped, and waiting for your thumbs-up.
5.	End of Day: Dashboard says your “behind-the-scenes” reel outperformed baseline by 37%, so Interkast bumps similar content in priority for next week.
(You, meanwhile, managed to actually eat lunch for once. Wild concept.)
