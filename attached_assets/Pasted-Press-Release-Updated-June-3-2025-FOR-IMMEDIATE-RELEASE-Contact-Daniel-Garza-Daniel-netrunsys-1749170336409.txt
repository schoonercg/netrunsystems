Netrun Systems Announces Interkon, Interfyx & Interkast — And a Vision for a Downtown Tech Center in Ojai
Ojai, California — June 3, 2025
From a valley famed for its laid-back mystique, Netrun Systems emerges to prove that automation, ethics, and art can belong on the same team.

The company’s new projects include:

Interkon – A cross-tenant cloud governance platform for MSPs, delivering enterprise-grade security and cost optimization—no matter how many client tenants they juggle.

Interfyx – A small-business optimization dashboard (priced from $200 to $500 monthly) that integrates with Square, QuickBooks, and other common tools, translating data into insights people actually understand.

Interkast – A social-automation and generative-media studio that keeps marketing campaigns genuinely social rather than “spammy.”

And on the horizon: a local Tech Center, complete with VR labs, electronics spaces, youth programs, and a strong coffee bar (guaranteed non-robotic).

“We’re showing that high-impact tech doesn’t have to be born in Silicon Valley,” says Daniel Garza, Co-Founder & CEO. “It can come from a place as eclectic as Ojai — for real humans who need real-world solutions.”

“I’m on board with AI — I just don’t think it can replace human creativity,” says Matt Jordan (also known as Cogex), Co-Founder & Chief Creative. “Sure, AI can churn out a decent bass line, but let’s face it: the best ones will still come from actual musicians.”

Why Ojai?
Creative Spark – Ojai’s mix of artists, farmers, and free spirits helps keep Netrun’s work honest and imaginative.

Community Focus – The planned Tech Center will offer public workshops, open maker spaces, and local events that make tech less intimidating.

Small-Town Ethos – By rooting themselves in Ojai, Netrun Systems aims to grow in harmony with the local community, rather than overshadow it.

(As always, everything’s subject to change faster than you can say “Ojai sunset.”)
