Netrun Systems Launches in Ojai to Reclaim Tech for Small Businesses and Humans
Ojai, California — 05-19-2025
A new kind of technology company has emerged from the Ojai Valley — one that believes automation should empower humans, not replace them.
Introducing Netrun Systems, a technology startup founded by Daniel Garza, a cybersecurity architect, creative entrepreneur, and local business owner, and Matt Jordan, a visual artist, music producer, and Creative Director who proudly refers to himself as Netrun’s “resident human” and “AI skepticism department.”
Together, they’re building something rare: a company at the intersection of automation, ethics, art, and community — rooted right here in Ojai, California.
“We’re not just building another Silicon Valley clone,” says Garza. “We’re creating tools for real people — the artists, shopkeepers, consultants, and community builders who deserve better tech.”
“AI doesn’t have taste,” adds Jordan. “That’s why I’m here. My job is to make sure what we build still feels human — because the minute we start outsourcing creativity, we’ve lost the plot.”
Small Town. Big Mission.
Netrun Systems is focused on making enterprise-level automation and analytics accessible to small businesses, local entrepreneurs, and underserved communities. Its flagship tool, Nexus, helps IT consultants and service providers manage Azure cloud environments across multiple clients — a long-overdue solution in a world drowning in complexity.
The company is also developing:
•	SparqBot – an AI-powered tutor designed to support real teachers, not replace them.
•	Wilbur – a human-guided framework for building ethical AI agents.
•	Sunflower – an IoT device for monitoring garden and agricultural conditions.
•	BizPilot, The Small Business Optimization Suite – providing real-world tools for marketing, content, and operations without the tech headaches.
Creative Tech. Community Roots.
Garza and Jordan bring complementary skills to the table. Garza is a veteran of the cybersecurity and cloud architecture world, with decades of experience managing complex systems. Jordan is a visual and musical force known for his analog design approach, his work with Soma Synths, and a design philosophy rooted in emotional intelligence and punk rock aesthetics.
“Matt's the only person I know who can design a product, score its launch video, and then argue with me about the ethics of GPT — all in one afternoon,” says Garza. “He’s the reason our products look stunning and stay grounded.”
Their shared belief? Technology should serve humanity, not the other way around.
Ojai is the Origin Story
The company is currently seeking investors and partners to acquire a downtown property that would house both Netrun’s headquarters and a community-facing Tech Engagement Center — offering public access to VR demos, electronics labs, media creation spaces, and youth training programs.
“We’re planting our flag here,” says Jordan. “Ojai is weird, creative, brilliant, and stubborn — perfect soil for a tech company that actually gives a damn.”
