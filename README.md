# Netrun Systems Website

This is a Flask-based website for Netrun Systems, showcasing the company's cross-tenant Azure governance solutions.

## Repository Structure

- `app.py` - Flask application entry point
- `/static` - Static assets
  - `/css` - Stylesheets
  - `/images` - Images and logos
  - `/js` - JavaScript files
- `/templates` - HTML templates
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- `.github/workflows` - GitHub Actions workflow for Azure deployment

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the application:
```
python app.py
```
